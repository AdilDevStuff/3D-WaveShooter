# Why open source this project?
I was working alone on this one since last week and decided to make this project open source. No reason, just wanted to work on this with others and complete this simple game as a community project.

# Who can contribute?
Well, anyone. If you are a godot game developer and know gdscript programming language, you can help me in making this game. But you don't have to be a programmer to help. You can contribute in any way possible. Like making models (cuz im not a 3D modeller), sound, levels or even by just playing the game and giving feedback about certain mechanics and stuff.

That's all! Who wants to contribute, can check the Projects tab to know what's going on with the project and what is needed to be done!
